# Polynomials and Rational Functions for KMath

KMath provides a way to work with uni- and multivariate polynomials and rational functions. It includes full support of arithmetic operations on integers, **constants** (elements of the ring that polynomials are built over), variables (for certain multivariate implementations), polynomials and rational functions encapsulated in the so-called **polynomial space** and **rational function space** and some other utilities, such as algebraic differentiation and substitution.
